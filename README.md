This project aims to analyze individual player performances during the final match of the Copa America 2024, played between Argentina and Colombia at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami on July 15, 2024. The Copa America is the oldest and most prestigious men's soccer tournament in the Americas, having been inaugurated in 1916. This year's final saw Argentina claim victory, with Lautaro Martinez scoring the decisive goal in the 112th minute of extra time.

In this analysis, I use a match events dataset to explore key individual player statistics from the final game. Leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, MPLSoccer, and StatsBombPy, along with Streamlit for visualization, I build an interactive app to showcase the findings. These tools allow me to extract and analyze match data, providing valuable insights into individual player contributions and overall team performance. The following list are the individual player statistics I'm showcasing in this interactive app:

* Complete vs Incomplete Passes
* Ball recovery 
* Shots on Goal 
* Fouls Committed 
* Player Activity Heatmap
* Player Sent Passes Heatmap
* Forward & Back Passes
* Goal & Shots Passes
